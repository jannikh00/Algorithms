## Course Description
This course explores algorithms from a coding-focused perspective, using Python. Students will learn about the issues that arise in the design of algorithms for solving computational problems and will explore a number of standard algorithm design paradigms and their applicability. Students will also become familiar with concepts of runtime, recursion, implementation, and evaluation. This course features a heavy emphasis on the practical application of algorithms to common development and engineering challenges.
